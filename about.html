  Hi, I'm Rasmus. This is a devlog about an RTS/tower defence game I'm working on.

  Polygons polygons polygons!

  Your job is to manage a small mining operation on a foreign planet. You must build up a mini-economy to be able to grow your population and build defences against the native beasts. It plays very arcadey, each level around 5-10 minutes. Each level is randomly generated and fog of war will hide your surroundings so you'll never know what lurks around the corner. Should you explore to find treasures or is it safer to stay and guard the miner? Time is ticking and when night falls... bad things come outâ„¢. All this expressed in a edged colorful polygonic art-style.

  I love writing game software from scratch and doing my best to get the details just right. Both in terms of techinicalities and in player experience. This approach feeds my unsatiable curisority - learn all the things!
  And also, it leads to products I'm deeply proud of.

  Doing things properly without compromise, no matter how hard, is what makes me happy. So I do it.

  I'm interested in entity/component architectures, AI/path finding, physics simulation, rendering, and realtime network synchronization.
  I like spending time pondering design issues about how to connect all these systems in the most useful, elegant, and simple ways.
