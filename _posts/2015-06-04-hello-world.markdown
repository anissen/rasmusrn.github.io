I think I was 12 years old when it started. Somehow, I'd managed to get <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> up and running and made a very simple web page that asked "What is your name?" I typed "Rasmus" and hit enter. My script replied "Hi Rasmus". At that moment something clicked in my brain. I could build anything with this computer-machine-thingy!

After a while I realized, that I could not actually build *anything*. In fact, I couldn't really do much because I didn't know anything about programming. But I was hooked.

Since then I've been working with software, especially game development. In 2006 I founded Playonic, a web game studio. Playonic's flagship game from back then is still alive and kicking at [virtualmanager.com](http://www.virtualmanager.com/). I had great time with the company but a couple of years ago, I decided it was time for me to start over. I wanted total creative freedom and I could only get that by leaving the company.

I wanted to somehow break into the "traditional" games industry (in contrast to the web game industry that I came from). I'd been programming for many years, but I knew next to nothing about "real" game development. At first, I considered using [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) or some similar game engine. These engines are great because they do the heavy lifting for you. You don't have to understand how it works. However, my inborn curiosity and perfectionism wouldn't let me do it. I had to know how it all worked!

So I spent my savings on a full-time gung ho study-frenzy of anything gamedev-related: Linear algebra, graph theory, OpenGL rendering, physics simulation, game AI, game engine architecture, realtime network synchronization, entity/component systems, and a bunch of other things. Read, experiment, repeat. It was tiresome but awesome.

After a year or so my girlfriend was going crazy because I never left our apartment. I decided to rent a little office space. In retrospect, I can see this was a wise move.

As my understanding of game development grew, I slowly ventured into building actual prototypes and small games.

It turns out the experienced developers are right: game development *is* hard. But after countless prototypes and failed game projects, I'm now finally on the right track to build a fun game. At least I think I am. With this project, I feel really hopeful about both the concept and the implementation. Here's a screenshot of the game:

  Doesn't look like 6 months of hard work, does it? Building everything from scratch takes time :)

In the game you manage a small mining operation on a foreign planet. You must build up a mini-economy to be able to grow your population and build defences against the native beasts. It plays very arcadey, each level around 5-10 minutes. Each level is randomly generated and fog of war will hide your surroundings so you'll never know what lurks around the corner. Should you explore to find valuable resources or is it safer to stay and guard the miner? Time is ticking and when night falls... bad things come outâ„¢. All this expressed in a colorful polygonic art-style.

Oh, and it will support co-op multiplayer!

Anyway... the development of this game is what this devlog will be about. I hope you'll tag along :-)
