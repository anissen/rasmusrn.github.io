I think I was 12 years old when it started. Somehow, I'd managed to get <a href="http://php.net">PHP</a> up'n running and made a very simple web page that asked "What is your name?" I typed "Rasmus" and hit enter. My script replied "Hi Rasmus". Something clicked in my brain.

Since then I've been working with software, especially game development. I founded my own web game company and ran it profitably for 8 years. Our main product is still live and kicking at [Virtual Manager](http://www.virtualmanager.com/). A couple of years ago, I decided it was time for me to start over. I wanted total creative freedom and I could only get that by leaving the company. So I did.

I wanted to somehow break into the "traditional" games industry (in contrast to the web game industry that I came from). I'd been programming for many years, but I knew next to nothing about "real" game development. Of course, I could've made my life a bit easier by using Unity or some other game engine. But my inborn curiosity and perfectionism wouldn't let me.

Instead, I spent my savings on a full-time gung ho study-frenzy of anything gamedev-related: Linear algebra, graph theory, OpenGL rendering, physics simulation, game AI, game engine architecture, realtime network synchronization, entity/component systems, and a bunch of other things. Read, experiment, repeat. It was tiresome but awesome.

After a year or so my girlfriend was going crazy because I never left our apartment. So I rented a little office space. In retrospect, I think it was a healthy move.

As my understanding of game development grew, I slowly ventured into building actual prototypes.

After a year of starting over dozens of times, I'm now on the right track. At least I think I am. Here's a screenshot of the game:

Your job is to manage a small mining operation base on a foreign planet. You must build up a mini-economy to be able to grow your population and build defences against the native beasts. It plays very arcadey, each level around 5-10 minutes. Each level is randomly generated and fog of war will hide your surroundings so you'll never know what lurks around the corner. Should you explore to find treasures or is it safer to stay and guard the miner? Time is ticking and when night falls... bad things come outâ„¢. All this expressed in a edged colorful polygonic art-style.

Oh, and it will support co-op multiplayer!

Anyway... the development of this game is what this devlog will be about. I hope you'll tag along :-)
