<h1>Tickleworks</h1>
<p>Hello you! I hope you like game programming and elegant code. Because that's what this blog is about.</p>

<p>
  My name is Rasmus.
  I love writing game software from scratch and doing my best to get the details just right.
  This approach the game development is often painstakinly slow.
  The reason I enjoy it anyway is twofold.
  Firstly, it forces me to learn wonderful ideas and concepts about subjects I'm very passionate about.
  And secondly, this mindset leads to products I'm deeply proud of.
</p>

<p>
  Basically, doing it "the hard way" is what makes me happy :-)
</p>

<p>
  While I'm certainly not an expert in either of these fields, I've written a lot of
  entity/component systems, AI's, path finding systems, physics simulators, renderers, event systems, and realtime network communication systems.
  Basically most things related to game development.
  I'm particularly interested in the challenge of how we can connect all these systems in useful and elegant ways.
</p>

<p>Tickleworks is a blog where I write about my latest experiments and thoughts.</p>
